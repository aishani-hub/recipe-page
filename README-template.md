## Overview
The goal of my recipe page project is to create a visually appealing and responsive design using only HTML and CSS. It features an organized layout with recipe cards displaying essential details like titles and images. The design ensures compatibility across different devices, making it user-friendly and accessible. This project showcases my ability to craft a stylish and functional webpage solely with HTML and CSS, overcoming challenges related to layout and responsiveness while enhancing my front-end development skills.
